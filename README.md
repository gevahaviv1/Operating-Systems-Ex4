# Operating Systems Exercise 4

Welcome to the repository for the fourth assignment in the Operating Systems course. This project provides starter code, assignment instructions, and test materials to help you implement and test memory management modules in C++.

## Repository Structure

- `Resources/`   – C++ stubs for memory management implementation
- `ex4.pdf`      – Assignment instructions and detailed requirements
- `Test.zip`     – Sample tests and build scripts

## Getting Started

1. **Extract Resources:**
   - Unpack `Resources.tar` and `Test.zip` in the project directory.
2. **Read the Instructions:**
   - Open `ex4.pdf` for a detailed description of the tasks and requirements.
3. **Implement the Assignment:**
   - Complete the required modules as described in the PDF using the provided stubs.
4. **Build and Test:**
   - Use your preferred C++ toolchain to build the project and run the tests from `Test.zip`.

## Usage

After implementing the required modules:

```sh
# Example build and test commands (adjust as needed)
make
./run_tests.sh
```
