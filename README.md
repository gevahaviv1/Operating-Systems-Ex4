# Operating Systems Exercise 4

This repository contains the starter files for the fourth Operating Systems
assignment. The resources include code stubs, a PDF describing the tasks and
compressed archives with test material.

## Contents
- `Resources/` - memory management implementation stubs
- `ex4.pdf` - assignment instructions
- `Test.zip` - sample tests and build files

## Getting Started
1. Extract `Resources.tar` and `Test.zip`.
2. Follow the instructions in `ex4.pdf` to implement the required modules.
3. Build the project with your preferred C++ toolchain and run the tests.

This repository uses a `.gitignore` file to avoid committing the PDF and any zip
archives.
